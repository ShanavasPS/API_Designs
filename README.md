# Serializable and Deep copy API Designs

## Overview

This repository contains two powerful JavaScript utilities: `Serializable` and `UiUtils`, along with their detailed API designs.

### Serializable

The `Serializable` utility enhances JavaScript serialization and deserialization capabilities beyond standard `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` methods. It supports the serialization of class instances, including methods, decorators, and complex data structures like `Map`, `Set`, and `Date`.

For detailed information and API design, refer to the [Serializable Design Document](./serializable-design_v0.5.md).

### Deep copy

The `UiUtils` class provides utilities for deep copying JavaScript objects, handling complex types such as `Array`, `Set`, `Map`, and `Date`. It supports both shallow and deep copying, while preserving circular references and object prototypes.

For detailed information and API design, refer to the [UiUtils Design Document](./deep_copy-design_v0.1.md).
